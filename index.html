        <h1>Dear <span style="color: #e65a50;">Sunkudu,</span></h1>
        <p>I know our time together was short,
            but it meant a lot to me, even if I didn’t realize it at the time.</p>
        <p>When we started talking on July 27th 2024 , I never thought things would change so much between us. You loved
            me,
            and I didn’t understand how special that was. I said no to you many times, but when I finally said yes, I
            didn’t stay. I broke your heart, and for that, I am truly sorry.</p>
        <p>After we ended things, I thought I had made the right choice. But when you left and moved on, I started to
            see how much you cared for me and how much I had lost.</p>
        <p>You’re with Babu now, and I am happy if he is making you smile. You deserve to be happy, Sunkudu. I don’t
            want
            this letter to make things awkward between us. I just want you to know that I care for you and respect you a
            lot.</p>
        <p>As we meet on the 27th November 2024, I hope we can leave the past behind and remember the good moments we
            shared. I will
            always think of you with kindness and wish the best for you. Thank you for everything you gave me, even when
            I didn’t know how to value it.</p>
        <p>Take care,</p>
        <p><b>Sree</b></p>
